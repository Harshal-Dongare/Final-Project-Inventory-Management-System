# Inventory Management System - Phase 2 Summary

## Overview
Phase 2 of the **Inventory Management System** focuses on **querying and manipulating data** in the database. The SQL script includes a series of operations to retrieve, update, delete, and analyze data across various tables in the system. This phase builds on the database schema created in Phase 1 and provides practical examples of how to interact with the data.

## Key Features
- **Data Retrieval**: Fetch data from tables like `products`, `suppliers`, `orders`, `customers`, and more using `SELECT` queries.
- **Data Manipulation**: Perform `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations to manage records in the database.
- **Aggregation and Analysis**: Use `GROUP BY`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `AVG` to analyze data and generate insights.
- **Filtering and Sorting**: Apply `WHERE` clauses and `ORDER BY` to filter and sort data based on specific conditions.

## Summary
Phase 2 focuses on **practical SQL operations** to interact with the database. It includes:
- **Retrieving data** for analysis and reporting.
- **Updating and deleting records** to manage the database.
- **Adding new records** to expand the dataset.
- **Aggregating data** to generate insights.

This phase is essential for understanding how to work with the database in real-world scenarios.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement more complex queries for advanced analytics.
- Add stored procedures and triggers for automation.
- Integrate with a front-end application for a complete inventory management solution.
